Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)  
Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)  
Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)  
Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points)  
Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points)  
Q6: Cool Bonus: Do something extra! (+10 points)  
#### For EXTRAï¼Œthere are some hints:  
Other traditional features? (e.g. SIFT)  
Deep network features?(e.g. VGG)  
Other optimization methods?(e.g. Adam)  
Cool visualization(e.g. Features)  
Other kind of loss(e.g. CrossEntropy)  
I implement ADAM on the 2 layer NN in features.ipynb. In addition, I complete all the inline question.
